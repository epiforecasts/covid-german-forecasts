instructions <- '<h3> Welcome! </h3> 
                        Please read these instructions and terms carefully. If you agree, please click "I understand and consent" to access the app. If you do not consent, you cannot use this app. 
                        <br>
                        <h4> What this app does </h4>
                        This app is designed to collect forecasts from experts and non-experts. Predictions are made for weekly incident case numbers and deaths from Covid-19 in Germany and Poland. We do not create user accounts, so you need to reeenter your data every time you visit the app to make a forecast. 

                        <h4> Making Forecasts </h4>
                        You can either drag the points to adjust forecasts or use the numeric input fields. If you want to reset the forecasts, press reset. For reference, you can look at a plot with incident cases in the chosen location. 
                        <br>
                        <h4> Providing your name </h4>
                        Please provide your first and last name. If you prefer that you can also enter an imaginary name, but please be consistent. We do not create an account for you, so you need to be consistent in your naming between different forecasts you make. Also make sure you choose a name that is unique enough that nobody else will choose the same name. 
                        <h4> Providing your email address </h4>
                        We don’t want to force you to provide your email address. We would, however, very much encourage you to provide it. This makes identification easier and allows us to contact you in case we have questions or something went wrong. If you provide us your email address we will send you a weekly reminder for the forecasts.
                        <h4> Submitting Forecasts </h4>
                        When you are satisfied, type in your name and press submit. Once you submit a forecast, the next input will be selected until you have made forecasts for all targets. You can submit multiple times if you want and we will only count the latest submission. By submitting a forecast you agree that we can store and use your data and your forecasts in the ways outlined below.
                        <h4> Performance Board </h4>
                        If you like you can have your name appear on our Performance Board. Alternatively, you can appear as “Anonymous Forecaster” or not appear at all. If you change your mind and would like to have your name removed from the Performance Board, please send a message to nikos.bosse@lshthm.ac.uk.

                    Your first and last name (as well as your e-mail address if you choose to provide it) will be used to attribute forecasts to forecasters.
                    <br>
If you choose to provide your e-mail address we will send you a weekly reminder for the forecasts.

                    Your forecasts will be used for research on forecasting as well as on Covid-19. Use cases will include, but are not limited to:

                    <ul>
                    <li>Sharing anonymised and/or aggregate forecasts with other research institutions, especially the German Forecast Hub</li>
                    <li>Sharing anonymised forecasts on public repositories on github.com</li>
                    <li>Using anonymised versions of the forecasts for scientific publications about forecasting and/or Covid-19. </li>
                    <li>Sharing anonymised forecasts with the public</li>
                    </ul>
                    Under no circumstances will we share your personal data (your first and last name and your e-mail address) with anyone. 
                    
                    <h4>How do we store your data</h4>
                    Once you click submit, your data will be sent to a Google Sheet stored in a Google Drive folder. One sheet will hold your personal information (first name, last name, e-mail address) as well as an encrypted version of your name and a randomly generated forecaster ID. The encryption algorithm used is SHA-256. A second sheet will hold your encrypted name as well as your forecasts.
                    <br>
Every Monday, the forecast sheet will be cleared and forecasts will be deleted from Google Drive (information that links your personal information to the forecaster ID remains). Raw forecasts will be uploaded to Github, using only the randomised forecaster ID so forecasts cannot be attributed to the identity of individual forecasters. In addition, the performance board will be updated using the name you provided in the app.
                    <h4> How long do we store your data? </h4>
We will store the data as long as is necessary to conduct research on forecasting and Covid-19. We will store your personal information (name and email) as long as may be necessary to contact you with questions and updates. We expect to delete all personal information at the end of 2022.
<br>
Anonymised versions of your forecasts may be stored indefinitely, e.g. as part of a publication.
<br>
You can, at any point, request deletion of your personal data. To that end, please send an e-mail at nikos.bosse@lshtm.ac.uk.'
