# EpiForecats - Covid-19 Predictions for Germany and Poland

## Introduction and Context
This is a joint project that combines two forecasting approaches, EpiNow2 and EpiExpert. EpiNow2 is an exponential growth model that uses a time-varying Rt trajectory to predict future infections, reported cases and deaths. It makes very few assumptions and is not tuned to the specifities of Covid in Germany and Poland. Instead it serves as a simple, yet powerful epidemiological baseline model. Its predictions reflect what you would get from epidemiological first principles without taking into account any expert knowledge or tuning from the side of the modeler. EpiExpert, on the other hand, makes predictions by collecting forecasts from human experts and non-experts. In that sense it is a maximally tuned prediction model and reflects exactly what we (and others) think about the future trajectory of the pandemic in Germany and Poland. 

## Aim
Our aim is to
- make forecasts of cases and deaths to be submitted to the [German Forecast Hub](https://github.com/KITmetricslab/covid19-forecast-hub-de/)
- to analyse how a maximally tuned model that reflects the modeler's opinion fares compared with a computer model that is as independent as possible from the modeler's opinion. 

## Models

### Human forecasting
...


### EpiNow2
...
Runs an Rt based forecast model using [`{EpiNow2}`](https://epiforecasts.io/EpiNow2/). 




## Predictions
coming soon: predictions from both models tabbed by forecast date
